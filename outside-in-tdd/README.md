# Outside-in TDD

This repo contains an testing example from Chapter 4 â€” Building Tests in Refactoring, the 2nd edition. I use a special version of TDD, which is called Outside-in TDD, basically is writing an end-to-end test first then a unit test second. If you would like to know further about the topic, you can learn more from [this website](https://outsidein.dev/)!

For the testing tools I use, I choose [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/), and specifically React Testing Library for unit tests(component tests) and Cypress for end-to-end tests.
